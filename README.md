# playing_cards

A playing card activity to teach about measures of center. I built this app around the ideas from [mashupmath](https://mashupmath.com/blog/2017/3/29/teach-your-kids-to-multiply-using-area-models-m5fwb).

You can see how I use it [here](guide.md)

## Directions

[Open the card viewer](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html), and you will notice five different displays.

### Deck of cards (same data)

1. [One Deck](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=one_deck&nrow=4&ncol=13&arr=row&pg=1&labels=paths,suite&sort=suite;asc&filter=&sidebar=-1&fv=): Shows a full deck of 52 cards as the first view.
3. [Hand of 7 random cards](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=Hand_of_7&nrow=3&ncol=7&arr=row&pg=1&labels=paths,hand7_3&sort=hand7_3;asc&filter=&sidebar=-1&fv=)
2. [Hand of 6 random cards](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=Hand_of_6&nrow=3&ncol=6&arr=row&pg=1&labels=paths,hand6_1&sort=hand6_1;asc&filter=&sidebar=-1&fv=): 

### The mean deck of cards

I built the mean deck of card views to show the cards along a number line from 1-13 to help teach about the mean being a balancing point. You could use it to teach mode by the high stack of cards, but I don't think that is as useful as the cards only stack two high most of the time.

3. [Show mean hand of 7](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=Show_mean_hand_7&nrow=7&ncol=13&arr=row&pg=1&labels=hand7_1,value&sort=hand7_1;asc,value;asc&filter=&sidebar=-1&fv=)   
4 [Show mean hand of 6](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=Show_mean_hand_6&nrow=6&ncol=13&arr=row&pg=1&labels=hand6_1,value&sort=hand6_1;asc,value;asc&filter=&sidebar=-1&fv=)

# Discovering the Different Centers


### Background

Statisticians use the phrase ‘measures of center’ to describe the mean, median, and mode. This activity will focus on the mean and median using a playing card activity.  You can use physical cards or [these virtual cards](https://hathawayj.github.io/playing_cards/index.html#display=Hand_of_6&nrow=3&ncol=6&arr=row&pg=1&labels=paths,hand6_1,value&sort=hand6_1;asc,value;asc&filter=&sidebar=2&fv=). 


### Activity

Use a random hand of 6 cards and 7 cards a few times to learn about the mean and median of a set of numbers.  



1. Get a random hand of 6 or 7 cards.
2. Use the numbers on the cards to find the mean and median (Ace -1, Jack -11, Queen-12, King-13).
3. Mark the mean (x) and median (m) after entering the cards on the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bqw047XaG-gdcUrBIYLlAT8NuGcQaRkCK5q7_Qzyau0/template/preview).
4. Repeat this process a few times.

*   Why might you use a measure of center for your data?
*   Which measure of center do you prefer? 


### Tools Description

**Virtual Cards: ** The virtual cards tool allows you to look at different random hands of cards.  We will treat each card as a number from 1(ace) to 13 (king).  You can filter, arrange, and order the cards with the tool.  But the default view should be enough.

**Google Sheet (Cards): **We will use this sheet in tandem with the virtual cards tool to help us find and mark the mean and median.  The sheet requires you to enter the number of cards in your random hand for each card value.  Then calculations are performed for you in the right three columns.  Below where you enter values you can see the sum for that card number in your hand.
